# dronelang
This is dronelang, a simple project to create a script language to control a TELLO drone. It currently works on the command line and you need node.js to run the script, ffplay to view live video and ffmpeg to convert captured video to mp4.

Eventually, I would like the drone to be controlled vocally by verbally speaking the commands that would be translated by a speech recognition module to generate the script.
